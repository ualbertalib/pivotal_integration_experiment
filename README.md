# pivotal_integration_experiment
A usability test for using pivotal tracker to schedule work

The work flow appears to be:
* Put work into pivotal and prioritize backlog there
* Do commits here on github, but reference the pivotal stories in the commit
* ...?
* Profit!

The above is an example of some work added to the story

Okay the first time I committed, I forgot to put square braces around my story reference, this time I will add the following to the commit log:

[Fixes #142863541]

Let's see if that worked.
